## 🚨🚨🚨 Data access 🚨🚨🚨

Access to the data requires filling in the [**Data Usage Agreement**](https://forms.gle/Pnvv96zXbnaA3Tcp8) and accepting all the terms and conditions. Once the agreement has been processed, you will be added to the task's **Google Group**, where the password to extract the archives is communicated.

The data files are distributed as a **password-protected RAR archive**. We recommend extracting it with [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/) on Windows; on macOS you can use the command-line version of WinRAR or a free tool that supports encrypted RAR archives, such as [The Unarchiver](https://theunarchiver.com/) or [Keka](https://www.keka.io/); on Linux, `unrar x archive.rar`.




## Files

Training data for **StereoQueerEval** (SemEval 2027): detection of queer stereotypes and hate speech in YouTube comments, in **English, Italian and Dutch**. Persian data will be released only as part of the test set.

Each instance is a YouTube comment posted under a news video about LGBTQIA+ topics, annotated for the three subtasks. Comments are provided together with the title and description of the video they respond to, since the target of a comment is often only interpretable in context.

| File | Textual Triplets |
|---|---|
| `StereoQueerEval_EN_training.tsv` | 2,989 |
| `StereoQueerEval_IT_training.tsv` | 2,400 |
| `StereoQueerEval_NL_training.tsv` | 2,238 |

The test sets (English, Italian, Dutch _with the addition of Persian_) will be released according to the task schedule in January 2027.


## Format

UTF-8, tab-separated, one header line, fields quoted where needed.
⚠️ Titles, descriptions and comments may contain **newlines ("\n") inside quoted fields**: read the files with a proper TSV parser (e.g. `pandas.read_csv(..., sep="\t")`, Python `csv`, Hugging Face `datasets`), not with line-based tools.

## Columns

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `StereoQueerEval_id` | Unique instance ID, e.g. `training_EN_0001`. |
| `yt_title` | Title of the YouTube video. |
| `yt_description` | Description of the YouTube video. |
| `yt_comment` | The comment to be classified. |
| `stereotype` | Does the comment convey a stereotype about queer people? `yes` / `no`. |
| `hate_speech` | Is the comment hateful, and how? `no` / `yes_implicit` / `yes_explicit`. |
| `target` | Target of the hate: `none` if `hate_speech` is `no`; otherwise scope (`group` or `individual`) + one or more target identities, e.g. `group_lgbtqia+`, `individual_t,nb`. |

Target identities: `l`, `g`, `b`, `t`, `q`, `i`, `a`, `nb` (non-binary), `lgbtqia+` (the community as a whole), always listed in this order. `target` is present **if and only if** the comment is hateful, if the comment is not hateful then `target` must default to `none`.
